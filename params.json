  "body": "#qst - quasi simple terminal\r\nqst is a modified version of [st](http://st.suckless.org), the simple terminal\r\nemulator for X which sucks less. Compared to plain st it has scrollback support\r\nand rxvt's intensityStyles option emulation.\r\n\r\n#Requirements\r\nNo other requirements rather than the Xlib header files, as in regular st.\r\n\r\n#Installation\r\nEdit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into the `/usr/local`\r\nnamespace by default).\r\n\r\nAfterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if necessary as\r\nroot):\r\n\r\n    make clean install\r\n    \r\nNote that the provided `config.h` is different from `config.def.h` as it\r\ncontains a set of pre-made customizations. Feel free to modify it to your\r\nliking.\r\n\r\n#Running st\r\nIf you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile the st\r\nterminfo entry with the following command (again, as root if necessary):\r\n\r\n    tic -s st.info\r\n\r\nSee the man page for additional details.\r\n\r\n#Credits\r\nBased on Aur√©lien APTEL <aurelien dot aptel at gmail dot com> bt source code.\r\nScrollback implementation inspired by the official upstream patch.\r\n",
